# Elden Ring map slicer

Used to slice elden ring .tga map files into [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) map tiles.

## Usage

You can run the cli with `go run .` or by installing it with `go install github.com/metruzanca/convergence-map/slicer@latest`

Cli help screen should get your going.

The files to slice, you must get yourself. I cannot provide those here (_also they're like 420mb each_).
