## Elden Ring tile map

Heavily inspired by Fextralife's map of elden ring. I wanted to bring something similar to mods of the game.

See [Github Board](https://github.com/users/metruzanca/projects/9/views/1) for work being done.

## Development

No environment variable loader is used. For development purposes, you can use [direnv](https://direnv.net) or another solution to auto load/unload variables.

| Variable                 | Default        | Usage                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `TILES_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` | _pwd, I think_ | Directory tiles are saved when using the slicer |
